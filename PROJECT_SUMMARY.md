# EU AI Act Guide - Project Summary

## Project Overview and Purpose

The EU AI Act Guide is a comprehensive, multilingual web resource designed to help businesses, policymakers, researchers, and the general public understand the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act.

## Technical Architecture Overview

The EU AI Act Guide website employs a lightweight, accessible technical architecture designed for ease of maintenance and contribution:

1. **Frontend Technologies**
   - HTML5 for semantic markup
   - CSS3 for responsive styling
   - Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
   - No external frameworks to minimize dependencies

2. **Internationalization Framework**
   - JSON-based translation files
   - Dynamic language switching
   - Persistent language preferences via localStorage

3. **Deployment Architecture**
   - Static site hosting via GitHub Pages
   - No backend dependencies
   - Optimized for performance and accessibility

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Git-based version control
   - Pull request review process
   - Automated deployment via GitHub Actions

## Multilingual Support Details

The website currently supports 5 languages with complete translations:

| Language | Code | File           | Coverage |
|----------|------|----------------|----------|
| English  | en   | en.json        | 100%     |
| French   | fr   | fr.json        | 100%     |
| German   | de   | de.json        | 100%     |
| Spanish  | es   | es.json        | 100%     |
| Italian  | it   | it.json        | 100%     |

The internationalization system is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the addition of new languages through the creation of new JSON translation files. All user-facing content is externalized in these files, ensuring consistent translation across the site.
